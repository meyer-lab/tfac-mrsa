<!-- Introduction to the paper. -->

Here, we use a tensor factorization approach to integrate the transcriptional and cytokine responses to MRSA infection. This data integration approach allows us to identify consistent patterns of immunologic response across both types of data. Specifically, we identify a distinct innate and adaptive immune signature, present in both types of data, that together predict disease outcome. The combined data model predicts outcome better than either data type on its own, and its predictive accuracy is validated in an independent cohort. In total, this provides an approach to identifying integrative signatures of clinical immune response and dysfunction.
