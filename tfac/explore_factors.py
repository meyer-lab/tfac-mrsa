    """Perform GSEA on the gene factor matrix, with each component done individually. Each of the 2 best predicting components from SVC are then compared to the other 37
    to find which gene set are uniquely enriched in that component.

    Some important things to note - the library chosen and the ultimate unique gene sets that are relevant depend upon the application.
    For our purposes, we wanted to look at the immune system, and decided that observing enrichment of certain cell types would be a better method than looking at
    smaller cellular programs, thus we chose libraries of cell types. The results were examined manually, as there were many gene sets irrelevant to us - such as
    cell types that were not among the samples taken nor involved in the immune system. Gene sets that appeared as highly unique - aka with a normalized
    enrichment score greater in magnitude than in other components - and relevant are those determined to be enriched.

    Parameters:
    best_decomp (parafac2tensor): Decomposition with best status prediction
    best_comps (tuple): tuple of component pair that provides optimal prediction within SVC
    library (string): Name of Enricher library to use
    geneids (list): Ensembl ids for all genes in matrix
